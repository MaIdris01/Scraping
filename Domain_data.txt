What are website domains?






Simply put, a website domain refers to your domain name (often shortened to just domain), which is the name of your website. Specifically, it is the simplified form of an IP address that you type into a web browser to reach your destination website. However, having a domain name doesn't necessarily mean you have a website. Check out our powerful and easy-to-use website builder or read more about the differences between websites and domain names before you get started.

Why do I need a website for my business?






Every business needs a website, from the smallest local shops in your hometown to the largest conglomerates on the Forbes lists. Having a website provides plenty of benefits, beyond simply reaching a broader audience. A website can provide:
Credibility: Without a website, potential customers may question your authenticity or legitimacy. Having a website with a 'contact us' page and testimonials will make a great impression with your audience and builds credibility.
Branding: Branding is much more than just the name of your business. Everything, from the colors you use, your logo, or even the feelings associated with your business is your branding. Ensure you are representing your brand with a proper website. With the right design, you'll be starting off on the right foot with any prospective customer. Whether you are setting yourself apart from the competition or simply establishing yourself, you are limiting yourself without a website.
Organic Traffic: Once your website is complete and you are online you can start to show up in Google's search results, also called organic or natural search results. With the right optimizations, organic keywords can bring you thousands of visitors- all for free. Since organic positions aren't on the market to purchase, this gives smaller shops and businesses an opportunity to compete with larger competitors.
